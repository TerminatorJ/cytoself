# cytoself
cytoself is a self-supervised platform for learning features of protein subcellular localization from cell images.
Applying cytoself to images of 1311 endogenously labeled proteins from the recently released 
[OpenCell](https://opencell.czbiohub.org) database creates a highly resolved protein localization atlas
[[1]](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.29.437450v1). 
The representations derived from cytoself encapsulate highly specific features that can derive functional insights for 
proteins on the sole basis of their localization [[2]](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.29.437595v1).
